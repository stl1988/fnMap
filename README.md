# fnMap
Generates a PDF with the current Fortnite map and photos of each POI.

## Usage
First, open index.html in a plaintext editor of your choice. In order to use this, you have to register an account at fortniteapi.io. After logging in, go to dashboard.fortniteapi.io and copy your API key. Enter it into the index.html source where a comment tells you to put the API key (currently it's line 29).

After that, just open index.html in a web browser and it will generate the PDF for you.
